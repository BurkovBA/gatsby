## Introduction

It can be a lot of work to build new features for a website. Luckily, Gatsby's plugin ecosystem has thousands of prebuilt packages for you to choose from. By using a plugin, you can quickly add new functionality to your site without needing to build it from scratch yourself.

In this part of the Tutorial, you'll learn what plugins are and how to use them in your site.

## What is a plugin?

**Ship It!** ðŸš€

Before you move on, deploy your changes to your live site on Gatsby Cloud so that you can share your progress!

First, run the following commands in a terminal to push your changes to your GitHub repository. (Make sure you're in the top-level directory for your Gatsby site!)

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Finished Gatsby Tutorial Part 2"
git push
```

Once your changes have been pushed to GitHub, Gatsby Cloud should notice the update and rebuild and deploy the latest version of your site. (It may take a few minutes for your changes to be reflected on the live site. Watch your build's progress from your [Gatsby Cloud dashboard](/dashboard/?utm_campaign=tutorial).)

### Key takeaways

- A plugin is a package that lets you add new features to your site.
- Using plugins saves you time, since it's faster to install and configure a plugin than it is to recreate the same functionality from scratch.
- The general process for using a plugin is to install it, configure it in your `gatsby-config.js` file, and then (sometimes) to use it in your site.
- You can use the [Gatsby Plugin Library](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins) to browse all the available plugins and learn more about how each one works.


### What's coming next?

In Part 4, you'll learn about a specific category of plugins that let you pull data into your site: source plugins.
